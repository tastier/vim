Notice:
I add ctags, cscope, taglist and OmniCppComplete for my vim. Adding other plug-in may need to modify the vimrc.
You should install ctags and cscope first. Use sudo apt-get install ctags cscope.


Use:

cd ~

mkdir .vim/

cd .vim/

Then clone all files.( OmniCppComplete sometimes can't complete the struct of C code, I don't know why...)
